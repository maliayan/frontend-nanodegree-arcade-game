===============================

This is my submission for the "Classic Arcade Game Clone" project for "Front End Development Nanodegree Program" by Google and Udacity.

The artwork and game engine was provided by the instructors. I edited app.js file to add game logic and functionalities.

You can use arrow keys to interact with the game.

You can test and play the game via this link: https://maliayan.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/
