## Play

You can use arrow keys to move with the player.

Reach to the top, sea level, to increase your score.

Easy?

I think that I forgot to say something: Don't collide with bugs! A collision will reset the game and also your score!

You can play the game via this link: https://maliayan.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/

Enjoy!


## Explanation

This is my submission for the fourth project of Google Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program @ Udacity.

The artwork and game engine was provided by the instructors. I edited app.js file to add game logic and functionalities.

The purpose of this project was cloning a classic arcade game - Frogger.
